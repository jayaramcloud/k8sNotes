systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable <service_name>
systemctl start <service_name>
systemctl status <service_name> <-- quite handy to look up for location of the systemd service file

RESTART Kubernetes Master Services
for SERVICES in etcd kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler flanneld; do
	systemctl restart $SERVICES
	systemctl enable $SERVICES
	systemctl status $SERVICES
done

RESTART kubelet/node services

for SERVICES in kube-proxy kubelet flanneld docker; do
    systemctl restart $SERVICES
    systemctl enable $SERVICES
    systemctl status $SERVICES
done

Master: On your kubernetes master server, this will tell you if the proper services are active and enabled (flanneld may not be configured on your system):

# for SERVICES in etcd flanneld kube-apiserver kube-controller-manager kube-scheduler;
    do echo --- $SERVICES --- ; systemctl is-active $SERVICES ;
    systemctl is-enabled $SERVICES ; echo "";  done
--- etcd ---
active
enabled
--- flanneld ---
active
enabled
--- kube-apiserver ---
active
enabled
--- kube-controller-manager ---
active
enabled
--- kube-scheduler ---
active
enabled
Nodes: On each node, make sure the proper services are active and enabled:

# for SERVICES in flanneld docker kube-proxy.service kubelet.service; \
do echo --- $SERVICES --- ; systemctl is-active $SERVICES ; \
systemctl is-enabled $SERVICES ; echo "";  done
--- flanneld ---
active
enabled
--- docker ---

--- kube-proxy.service ---

--- kubelet.service ---
